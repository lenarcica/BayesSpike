BayesSpike R package on GitHub

This is the directories and code for the BayesSpike package, written by Alan Lenarcic and William Valdar
for investigation into sparse Bayes group confidence intervals.


With R or RTools installed:
"""
R CMD BUILD BayesSpike
"""
should make a tar.gz of the package.

"""
R CMD INSTALL BayesSpike_XXXXX.tar.gz
""""
will compile the code and install the R package directory.  It will prompt for several
required pacakges to be installed, particularly "RCpp".  At this time BayesSpike runs with RCpp 0.12.7 on R 3.3.1, but we will investigate whether
it operates on upgraded versions.

BayesSpike is a "single thread" gibbs sampler.  For multi-thread operations, BayesSpike can run mcmc chains independently or try out a differentmodel.
BayesSpike tries to identify small parameters sets O(100) out of large sets O(100000), and is particularly focussed on groups of parameters for which
a Bayesian Confidence measure of inclusion is desired.
