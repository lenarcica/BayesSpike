BayesSpike R package on GitHub

This is the directories and code for the BayesSpike package, written by Alan Lenarcic and William Valdar
for investigation into sparse Bayes group confidence intervals.

"Algorithmic Bayesian Group Gibbs Selection" by Alan Lenarcic and William Valdar should arrive on Arxiv shortly.

This is the algorithm and code used in BayesDiallel package and papers:
Lenarcic, Svenson, Churchill, and Valdar.  A general Bayesian approach to analyzing diallel crosses of inbred strains. 
  Published in Genetics, (no. 132563).

Crowley, Kim, Lenarcic, …, Sullivan, and Valdar.  Genetics in the Diallel: Heritable Architecture of Adverse Reactions to Haloperidol in Mouse. 
  Published in Genetics, (no. 156901) for 2014, co-first author as statistical theorist.


With R or RTools installed:
"""
R CMD BUILD BayesSpike
"""
should make a tar.gz of the package.

"""
R CMD INSTALL BayesSpike_XXXXX.tar.gz
""""
will compile the code and install the R package directory.  It will prompt for several
required pacakges to be installed, particularly "RCpp".  At this time BayesSpike runs with RCpp 0.12.7 on R 3.3.1, but we will investigate whether
it operates on upgraded versions.

BayesSpike is a "single thread" gibbs sampler.  For multi-thread operations, BayesSpike can run mcmc chains independently
 or try out a different model setting.
BayesSpike tries to identify small parameters set O(100) out of large sets O(100000), and is particularly focussed on groups of parameters for which
a Bayesian Confidence measure of inclusion is desired.

BayesSpike code here has a, similar to R, "GPL Version 2 or later" license and is provided as a suggestion of algorithm techniques,
data interfaces, and performance.
